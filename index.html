<section><h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1><img class="hat" src="img/six_hats.svg"><h2>Skillshare, Sep 2019</h2></section><section><h2>Edward de Bono</h2><img class="max" src="img/edwdeb.jpg"><aside class="notes">The inventor of the term "lateral thinking" in 1967. Created this methodology in 1985. 
The book is short and entertaining but Edward is a bit of a bighead.</aside></section><section><h2>The problem</h2><img class="hat" src="img/argument.svg"><aside class="notes">De Bono reckons the main reason meetings take so long and have trouble with goals is that they typically take the form of an argument.
An argument is when two people in the room are thinking from opposing perspectives and trying to "win". Aka "debate".</aside></section><section><section><h2>The solution</h2><img class="hat" src="img/house_viewing.svg"><aside class="notes">The solution is to have everybody thinking in the same direction at the same time.
De Bono uses this analogy with viewing a house.
Thinking is divided into six broad categories represented by coloured hats.
At any point in the meeting everyone knows what coloured hat is being worn.
Similar to Thinking Environment, it allows everyone to do all the thinking they need to do but without ego and competition.
De Bono gives real examples, like an ABB meeting that went down from 30 days to 2.
Breaking your thinking into these categories can be useful for individual thinking, but if it's used in a meeting...</aside></section><section><h2>Important!</h2><img class="hat" src="img/same_time.svg"><aside class="notes">It's essential you don't have different people wearing different hats.
Doing so just labels the existing argument/conflict.
The key to Six Thinking Hats is everyone wearing the same hat at the same time.
Hats can be changed often, but everyone has to change.</aside></section></section><section><section><h2>White hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/white_hat.svg"><p>Facts &amp; objectivity</p><aside class="notes">Facts can be first hand (verifiable) or second hand (likely, in which case their likeliness should be specified too).
Be careful not to use facts as a springboard for other types of thinking until the other hats.
You can use the white hat to fill gaps in knowledge that need filling for the other hats.
Analogy: a page.</aside></section><section><h2>Red hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/red_hat.svg"><p>Emotions &amp; intuition</p><aside class="notes">Emotions &amp; hunches provide background, not answers. But many meetings try to suppress them entirely: here is a place for them.
Thinking like "that's a very interesting idea" count as red hat thinking.
Useful to interrupt the flow with a red hat if you have a strong feeling like "I don't like this".
Analogy: seeing red.</aside></section><section><h2>Black hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/black_hat.svg"><p>Critical thinking &amp; risk assessment</p><aside class="notes">Perhaps the most important hat, but often overused. Critical thinking is good for looking for things you've missed.
<a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/rhetological-fallacies/" target="_blank">My favourite infographic!</a>
If critical thinking creates blockages, they can be unblocked by green.
Analogy: serious.</aside></section><section><h2>Yellow hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/yellow_hat.svg"><p>Constructive thinking &amp; positivity</p><aside class="notes">Hope and positive thinking. What's the value/benefit of what we're discussing? What's the potential?
Constructive thinking. Try the idea out under various "if" assumptions and best case scenarios.
Not meant to be objective and balanced, only positive. Could be "nothing positive", which is also a yellow hat outcome.
Remember it's about thinking constructively about existing ideas, not generating new ones (green).
Analogy: sunny.</aside></section><section><h2>Green hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/green_hat.svg"><p>Creative thinking &amp; possibilities</p><aside class="notes">Possibilities/alternatives. Anything goes. Don't criticise ideas during green. 
Lateral thinking - creates movement and unsticks things. The dictionary game.
Po! Explain this.
Constraint like this sometimes bestows creativity on people seen as "uncreative".
Ideas are just that - they need interrogating under the other hats.
Analogy: growth.</aside></section><section><h2>Blue hat</h2><img class="hat" src="img/blue_hat.svg"><p>Thinking about thinking: goals, conclusions, order</p><aside class="notes">The meeting itself: which hats to use, goals, conclusions, time management, next steps.
Used at the beginning and end, and when we need to think about the meeting.
Analogy: the sky.</aside></section><section><h2>Some notes</h2><div class="flex"><img class="hat" src="img/notes.svg"><ul><li class="fragment">Refer to hats by colour</li><li class="fragment">It's a game; rules are fun</li><li class="fragment">Anyone can suggest changing hats</li></ul><aside class="notes">Makes sense for one person to keep the rules in order by partially wearing the blue hat throughout.
When hats change, everyone goes under the new hat. Could be temporary, e.g. for a red or blue hat moment.</aside></div></section></section><section><h2>Let's give it a go</h2><p>Six Hats the venue for Skillshare</p><img class="hat" src="img/venue.svg"><aside class="notes">Everyone put on blue hats and let's go!</aside></section>
